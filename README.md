## 📓 About
##### Simple application and easy usability. Just take the page link and put it in the bar indicating "Cole aqui" and then it will shorten it. Now it's just sharing in an easy and super fast way. Another page is where all the generated links are saved, and you can delete them whenever you want. When you unlink from the site, the history will not disappear because everything will remain in the database.
